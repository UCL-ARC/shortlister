## Learning notes

Pickle: python module    
pickling = converting object into binary files  
unpickling = the inverse operation of pickling, converts binary file back to object
pathlib = library for working with file paths
glob = fetches files

MVC design: separate into Model(data/logic),View(output) and Controller(mediator)
currently controller object contains loads all the data in using functions in model, and using functions in view, it prints out the results.
